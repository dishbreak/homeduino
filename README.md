# Introduction

This is an archive of source code from a design project I did as an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego. Note that my partner and I finished this project back in 2010, so you shouldn't be looking here for any cutting edge development.

# Libraries

This code used the following libraries

* [Arduino-IR](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote)
* X10 Controller library from BroHogan. He doesn't have a GitHub that I could find, but you can check his blog out [here](http://brohogan.blogspot.com/)
